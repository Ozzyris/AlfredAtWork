# Alfred @ Work
Alfred @ Work is the professional side of Alfred @ Home, He helps you manage your project and respect your deadline. One of the differences with the other management system is that you don't have an account, everyone has access to the same page with the same editing right. Deal with it. This project was done first for the association the Super Designer.
